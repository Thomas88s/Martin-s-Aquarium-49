               <p>We had all the momentum; we were riding the crest of a high and beautiful wave. . . . So now, less than five years later, you can go up on a steep hill in Las Vegas and look West, and with the right kind of eyes you can almost see the high-water mark—that place where the wave finally broke and rolled back.”</p>

       <h3>Tank Tips</h3>
       <section>
           <h5> Maintain Balance Before Adding Fish to a New Aquarium</h5>
           <p>Once you’ve set up your new tank, you’ll probably be anxious to fill it with fish, and that’s natural. But it’s important to be patient and go slowly. Remember that an aquarium is a living system, and it takes time to establish the balance that will keep its inhabitants thriving. Introduce just a few fish at first and wait a week or two before adding more to give the essential bacteria that filter the water time to grow. Test your aquarium water for ammonia and nitrite, and only add more fish if the levels are zero.</p>

           <h5>Don’t Worry if Your Fish Hide at First</h5>
           <p>Your first fish may hide a lot. Don’t worry, that’s normal. Being caught in a net at the store, placed in a bag and ending up in a new place tends to be scary for most fish. Make sure there are enough decorations in the aquarium to make them feel safe. Another reason fish hide is that when they don’t see other fish swimming around, they think there’s a predator lurking about. Don’t panic, as you add more fish and decorations, they’ll come out!</p>

           <h5> Aquarium Lighting Should Be Used to Create a Day and Night Cycle</h5>
           <p>Your fish need to rest! Put your aquarium light on a regular on/off cycle to give your fish some down-time and prevent unsightly algae growth. If your light doesn’t have a built-in timer (many do nowadays), a standard light timer from the hardware store will do just fine! Planted aquariums need 10 to 12 hours of light, while non-planted tanks do best with 6 to 8 hours.</p>
